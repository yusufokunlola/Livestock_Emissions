st.header("Introduction")
st.write("""
Ruminant animals, particularly cattle, play a crucial role in global food systems but also contribute significantly to climate change through their digestive processes. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is produced as part of normal digestion in these animals. The livestock sector accounts for approximately 14.5% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with ruminants being responsible for about half of this total.

Given the growing concern over climate change and the increasing demand for sustainable agricultural practices, there is a pressing need for accurate and reliable methods to assess and manage livestock emissions. This project addresses this critical need by developing innovative solutions for emission prediction and mitigation strategies.

st.header("Objectives")
st.markdown("""

1. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of methane (CH4) emissions from cattle across the globe, considering various factors such as breed, feed type, climate conditions, and management practices.

2. To develop and train machine learning and deep learning models capable of predicting CH4 emissions based on input parameters and environmental conditions.

3. To provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders in the agricultural sector, policymakers, and environmental organizations to reduce livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

By achieving these goals, the project aims to contribute significantly to global efforts to combat climate change while supporting the continued development of the livestock industry through more efficient and environmentally conscious practices.
