# Livestock Emissions Project

## Introduction

The Livestock Emissions Project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at understanding, analyzing, and addressing one of the most significant environmental challenges associated with animal agriculture: methane (CH4) emissions from cattle on a global scale. This project combines cutting-edge scientific research with advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to analyze emission patterns and trends, ultimately providing insights and recommendations for stakeholders to make informed decisions about managing and reducing livestock emissions.


## Background

Ruminant animals, particularly cattle, play a crucial role in global food systems but also contribute significantly to climate change through their digestive processes. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is produced as part of normal digestion in these animals. The livestock sector accounts for approximately 14.5% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with ruminants being responsible for about half of this total.

Given the growing concern over climate change and the increasing demand for sustainable agricultural practices, there is a pressing need for accurate and reliable methods to assess and manage livestock emissions. This project addresses this critical need by developing innovative solutions for emission prediction and mitigation strategies.


## Objectives

1. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of methane (CH4) emissions from cattle across the globe.

2. To develop and train machine learning models capable of predicting cattle CH4 emissions.

3. To provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders in the agricultural sector, policymakers, and environmental organizations to reduce livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable agriculture practices.

By achieving these goals, the project aims to contribute significantly to global efforts to combat climate change while supporting the continued development of the livestock industry through more efficient and environmentally conscious practices.

## Dashboard

Before running the app, ensure that you have `Streamlit` installed. You can install Streamlit using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

## Demo

You can access the live demo of the app here: [Livestock Emissions Dashboard](https://livestockemissions.streamlit.app/)

### Initiating the App

To run the app locally, clone the repository on your local machine. Then, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run 1_üè†_Introduction.py
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser.
